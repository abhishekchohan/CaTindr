## CaTindr
CaTindr is a product landing page. It's design is based on mobile first approach. This project uses basic HTML, CSS and Vanilla javascript at its core although I have implemented other technologies to have cool animations. 

#### Technologies:
1. HTML, CSS & Javascript
2. JQuery (SmoothScroll Effect)
3. ScrollReveal Library (Animations)
4. Bootstrap (Cards and some other UI components)
5. Deployed on github-pages

#### Live Demo:  https://abhishekchohan.github.io/CaTindr/
